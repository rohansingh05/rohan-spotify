# 🎵 Rohan Spotify – Clone Project

A Spotify-inspired music player built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This is my second cloning project, where I explored and practiced core JavaScript concepts such as **`async/await`**, **event handling**, and the **Fetch API**.

## ✨ What I Learned

- ⚡ Using **async/await** for handling asynchronous code

- 🎛️ Implementing **event handling** for music controls

- 🌐 Working with the **Fetch API** to load songs dynamically

- 🧩 Strengthening my JavaScript fundamentals
  
## 🚀 Features

- Spotify-like user interface

- Play and pause functionality

- Music controls and event handling

- Fetching and managing songs dynamically

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structure

- **CSS** – for styling

- **JavaScript** – for functionality
